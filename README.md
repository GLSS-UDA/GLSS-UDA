# About

SNV and Hand gesture dataset contains NIR images and corresponding masks which can be used for the task of Unsupervised domain adaptation for the task of skin segmentation.

*Examples of Images and corresponding masks*

*Qualitative comparison of predicted segmentation skin masks on SNV and Hand Gesture datasets with standard UDA methods. Top four rows shows skin masks for SNV dataset and the last four are the masks for Hand Gesture dataset. It is evident that GLSS predicted masks are very close to the GT masks as compared to other UDA methods. (SO=Source Only, ASN=AdaptSegNet, GT=Ground Truth)*
